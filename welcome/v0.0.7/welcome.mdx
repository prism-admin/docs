Welcome to Alto! Alto is the easiest way to run your code on the cloud. Although
primarily designed for [Prism](https://runprism.com) projects, Alto can be used to execute any arbitrary code
(e.g., a function, a script, a Jupyter notebook, or an entire project) in custom cloud
environments.

At the moment, Alto is BYOC - bring your own cloud. You supply the cloud account, and
Alto will take care of provisioning the exact resources required. In future versions,
we'll offer the option for users to run their code on Alto's own infrastructure.

## CHANGELOG

Here are the main differences between this version and the previous version (```alto v0.0.7```):
  <Accordion title="`--verbose` CLI flag">      
    Previously, Alto would log all events from every stage of the infrastructure build and
    entrypoint execution. Now, users by default get a condensed version of the console
    events and can use `--verbose` to see all log events.

## Why use Alto?

  Great question! Alto allows users to easily scale their code from their local machine to
  the cloud. There are several scenarios in which this can be helpful:

  - **Scalability**: certain agents (e.g., EC2 instances, EMR clusters) allow you to scale your
  project's execution vertically and horizontally. You can choose instance types with
  varying compute power to match your project's resource requirements. Additionally, you
  can leverage auto-scaling capabilities to automatically adjust the number of instances
  based on demand.

  - **Collaboration**: we've all heard the age-old phrase "but it works on my machine!" When
  working with a team, it's likely that different team members will have different system
  configurations and environments. As a result, projects may work on one developer's
  machine but fail on others. Alto mitigate against this this, ensuring that their code
  runs consistently across different systems.

  - **Deployment**: Alto allow users to test their projects whatever infrastructure they like.
  If your organization uses custom infrastructure, then this helps ensure that your
  projects do not break once they are deployed.
