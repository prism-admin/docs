## Installation

  Alto requires Python 3.8 and above. It can be installed via `pip`:

  ```
  $ pip install --upgrade pip
  $ pip install alto-dev
  ```

## Creating your first project

  Alto has a powerful CLI that allows users to instantiate, modify, and execute their
  projects. To initialize your first project, use `alto init`:

  ```
  $ alto init

  What type of cloud environment do you want to use [ec2]? ec2
  What would you like the name of your configuration file to be (default: alto.yml)?

  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO | Building configuration file...
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO | Done!
  ```

  This command builds an Alto configuration file in your current directory. Configuration
  files are simple YAML files, so don't worry about having to learn a new domain-specific
  language.


## Running your first project

  To run your project on your cloud environment, use the `alto build` command. Under the
  hood, this command:

    - Builds the cloud environment according to instructions contained in the configuration file, and
    - Executes your project on the cloud.

  Here's what the build command does when the user wants to run their code on an EC2
  instance:

  ```
  $ alto build -f nomad.yml
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[build]  | Created key pair my_cloud_agent
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[build]  | Created security group with ID sg-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX in VPC vpc-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[build]  | Created EC2 instance with ID i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[build]  | Instance i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is pending... checking again in 5 seconds
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[build]  | Instance i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is pending... checking again in 5 seconds
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[build]  | Instance i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is pending... checking again in 5 seconds
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[build]  | Instance i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is pending... checking again in 5 seconds
  ...
  ...
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[run]    | Done!
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[delete] | Deleting key-pair my_cloud_agent at /../../../my_cloud_agent.pem
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[delete] | Deleting instance i-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  <HH:MM:SS> | INFO  | my_cloud_agent[delete] | Deleting security group sg-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  ```

  Alternatively, you could use the alto apply command to first build the cloud environment and then use alto run to actually run the code.
