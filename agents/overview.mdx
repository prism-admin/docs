  Alto was designed to be extraordinarily lightweight â€” that way, users can focus on
  writing their core code rather than fiddling with their cloud environments.

  One of the main concepts in Alto is **agents**. Agents are custom runtime environments in
  the cloud. The configuration for agents is defined in a YAML file, and it's designed to
  be (mostly) cloud-agnostic. That is, the configuration file shouldn't change
  dramatically whether you're running your code on an EC2 instance, a EMR cluster, or a
  GCP virtual machine.

  Alto currently supports the following agents:
  - EC2

  We're just getting started, so please let us know if you use a cloud environment that
  isn't current supported!
