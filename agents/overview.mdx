  Alto was designed to be extraordinarily lightweight â€” that way, users can focus on
  writing their core code rather than fiddling with their cloud environments.

  One of the main concepts in Alto is **agents**. Agents are custom runtime environments
  in the cloud. The configuration for agents is defined in a
  [YAML](/agents/configuration/v0.0.8/jinja_yaml) file, and it's designed to be (mostly)
  cloud-agnostic. That is, the configuration file shouldn't change dramatically whether
  you're running your code on an EC2 instance, a EMR cluster, or a GCP virtual machine.

  <Note>
  Agents are currently configured using YAML. In the future, users will be able to
  express agent and image configurations entirely in code.

  Alto currently supports the following agents:
  - [EC2](/agents/configuration/v0.0.8/infra/ec2)

  We're just getting started, so please let us know if you use a cloud environment that
  isn't current supported!
