description: Learn how to configure your agent in YAML
---

## Overview
  Agents are configured using a YAML file. The file should define:
  - The infrastructure to use (e.g., an EC2 instance)
  - Actions to perform within the infrastructure (e.g., installing custom Linux packages)
  - Your project's dependencies (i.e., Python packages)
  - Your project's entrypoint (i.e., what command to use to actually execute your project)
  - Environment variables
  - Files to download upon the project's completion

## Example
  Here's an example configuration file:
  ```yaml alto.yml
  my_cloud_agent:
    infra:
      type: ec2  
      instance_type: t2.micro
      ami_image: ami-0889a44b331db0194
    requirements: requirements.txt
    entrypoint:
      type: script
      cmd: python <script name>.py --arg1 VALUE1
    env:
      ENV_VAR1: "{{ env('ENV_VAR1') }}"
  ```
