title: 'entrypoint'
description: The `entrypoint` key defines how your code should be run
version: 'v0.0.7'

## Overview
  ```yaml alto.yml
  ...
  entrypoint:
    type: script
    cmd: python <script name>.py --arg1 VALUE1
  ...
  ```

  The `entrypoint` key should contain a set of key-value pairs that describe how your
  code should be accessed in your cloud infrastructure. Different entrypoints will have
  slightly different acceptable key-value pairs; however, they all must have `type`
  value.

  <Warning>If your `entrypoint` does not contain a `type`, then Alto will throw an error!</Warning>

## Key Specification

  Different entrypoints have slightly different key-value specifications. We list these
  below:

  <Accordion title="type: script">
    - `src`: the directory containing the script to execute. This directory should be
    specified relative to the configuration YAML. This is an **optional** field.
    - `cmd`: the command used to execute the script, e.g., `python main.py`.

    Example:
    ```yaml alto.yml
    ...
      entrypoint:
        type: "script"
        cmd: "python main.py"
    ...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="type: function">
    - `src`: the directory containing the script to execute. This directory should be
    specified relative to the configuration YAML. This is an **optional** field.
    - `cmd`: the command used to execute the script, formatted as `<module_name>.<function_name>`
    - `kwargs`: the function's keyword arguments formatted as a set of key-value pairs.

    Example:
    ```yaml alto.yml
    ...
      entrypoint:
        type: "function"
        cmd: "main.write_txt_file"
        kwargs:
          fname: "test.txt"
    ...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="type: jupyter">

    - `src`: the directory containing the script to execute. This directory should be
    specified relative to the configuration YAML. This is an **optional** field.
    - `cmd`: the notebook to execute, formatted as `<notebook_name>.ipynb`
    - `kernel`: the Jupyter runtime environment. The default is `python3`
    - `params`: the notebooks parameters formatted as a set of key-value pairs. Notebooks
      can be parametrized with Papermill! Check out the documentation [here](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage-parameterize.html).

    Example:
    ```yaml alto.yml
    ...
      entrypoint:
        type: "jupyter"
        cmd: "main.ipynb"
        params:
          alpha: 0.1
          ratio: 0.1
    ...
    ```
  </Accordion>
