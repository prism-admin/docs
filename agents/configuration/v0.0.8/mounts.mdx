## Overview
  ```yaml alto.yml
  ...
  mounts:
    - "../data/"
  ...
  ```

  The `mounts` key contains a list of paths to copy onto your infrastructure.

  <Note>By default, the working directory (i.e., the directory with your YAML configuration
  file) is copied onto your infrastructure. The `mounts` key can be used to
  copy folders and/or files *outside* of your working directory onto your infrastructure.</Note>
