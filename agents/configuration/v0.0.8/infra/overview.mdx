description: The `infra` key defines the type of infrastructure on which to run your code
version: 'v0.0.8'

## Overview
  The `infra` key should contain a set of key-value pairs that describe infrastructure on
  which to run your code. Different kinds of infrastructures will have different
  acceptable key-value pairs; however, they all must have  a value for `type`.

  <Warning>
    If your `infra` does not contain a `type` key, then Alto will throw an error!
  </Warning>

  Next, we cover the specific configurations for the various accepted `type` values.
